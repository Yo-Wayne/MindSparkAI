Build a complete, responsive, mobile-first educational website using HTML + Tailwind CSS and optionally light JavaScript.
This site is part of a nonprofit initiative to empower rural school children in Taiwan to thrive in an AI-powered future. The goal is to teach them how to use AI tools, not build them — so they can create websites, summarize notes, make presentations, and express creativity, even without coding experience.

🔧 Site Requirements:
Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for all styling

Keep design minimal, clean, and friendly

Layout must be mobile-first and low-bandwidth compatible

All sections must be clearly separated with adequate spacing (py-20, mt-10, etc.)

Use comments in HTML to explain each section (<!-- Hero Section -->)

Use Poppins or Quicksand as the main font if available

🏗️ WEBSITE STRUCTURE & CONTENT
Build the website in the following order, all on the homepage (index.html):

1. Navigation Bar
Left side: Project logo or site name (e.g., AI for Future Minds)

Right side links:
Home | Courses | Playground | Get Involved | Contact

2. Hero Section
Background: light sky blue (bg-[#E0F2FE])

Centered content with:

🧠 Title (text-4xl to text-6xl):
"Empowering Rural Youth with AI Tools"

💬 Subheading (text-xl):
"Helping students build websites, summarize notes, and learn smarter using AI"

🔘 CTA Button: "Start Learning" → scrolls to course section

3. Mission Section
Centered paragraph (max-w-3xl mx-auto)

Use this exact mission text:

Our Mission

In today’s world, knowing how to use AI is just as important as reading and writing. Yet many rural students don’t have the tools or guidance to catch up. This project was created to help bridge that gap.

We believe the future belongs to those who use AI effectively, not just those who build it. Through hands-on workshops and an interactive website, we teach students in under-resourced communities how to use AI to build websites, summarize class notes, make presentations, generate creative stories, and explore engineering.

Our goal is to spark curiosity, build confidence, and ensure that no student is left behind in the age of AI.

Also include a row of impact stats below it:

“0 schools reached”

“6 AI tools included”

“100% free for all students”
