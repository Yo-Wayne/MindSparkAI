Build a complete, multi-page, professional educational website using HTML + Tailwind CSS (with optional light JavaScript if needed).

The site is part of a student-led initiative to bring AI literacy to rural students in Taiwan, helping them learn how to use AI tools — not build AI — so they can thrive in a world where ideas, problem-solving, and creativity matter more than raw coding.

The site should feel similar to engineeringtomorrow.org: clean, well-spaced, responsive, mobile-first, and professional. Avoid playful or childish styles. Use accessible fonts like Poppins, Inter, or Quicksand. Use Tailwind for all styling and maintain clean structure with clear sections and comments.

Mission Paragraph (use exactly this):
In today’s world, AI can code. AI can build websites. AI can generate entire projects in seconds.

The truth is — we no longer need more people who just know how to code.

What we need are people with ideas. People who know how to use AI as a tool to create, solve, and lead. The ones who will succeed aren’t those who compete with AI, but those who command it — who use it to bring visions to life, build what matters, and push boundaries that no program alone could imagine.

That’s what this project is about. We’re not teaching kids to build AI — we’re teaching them to wield it. Especially in rural communities where access to these tools is limited, we believe every student deserves a chance to explore, experiment, and create with the world’s most powerful technologies.

The future belongs to those who know what to do with AI — not just how to build it.
